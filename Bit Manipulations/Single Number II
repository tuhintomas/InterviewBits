Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.

Find that element which does not appear thrice.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.

Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example :

Input : [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output : 4





class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def singleNumber(self, A):
        int_size=32
        result=0
        for i in range(int_size):
            sum=0
            x=(1<<i)
            for j in range(len(A)):
                if A[j]&x:
                    sum+=1
            if sum%3==1:
                result=result|x
        return result
